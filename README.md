<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Wild Social is a social network made for wilders - students and teachers at Wild Code School Paris. Its main features are a wall allowing wilders to chat and a customizable profile page

This project is the first I made during my studies at Wild Code School. Our aim was to build a static website using HTML and CSS, and a bit of Javascript.
